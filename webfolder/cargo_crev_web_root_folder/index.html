            <h2>cargo-crev</h2>
            <p><b>cargo-crev</b> is
                  a cryptographically verifiable code review system for the
                  cargo (Rust) package manager:<br>
                  <a target="_blank"
                     href="https://github.com/crev-dev/cargo-crev">https://github.com/crev-dev/cargo-crev</a>
            </p>
            <p><b>cargo-crev</b> runs locally on the developer computer.<br>
                  It needs to be installed and initialized in a few steps.<br>
                  It takes some time to initialize it and learn how to use it.
                  <b>cargo-crev</b> is a relatively new project and the majority
                  of
                  rust developers don't have it installed yet.<br>

            <h2>cargo_crev_web</h2>
            <p>
                  I created <b>cargo_crev_web</b> to enable all developers to
                  query crev reviews.<br>
                  There is no installation, initialization or learning needed.
                  It is just a simple web page.<br>
                  I wish that crates.io will have some day a link to
                  <b>cargo_crev_web</b> just like today it has links to
                  documentation and repository.<br>
                  It simply shows a list of reviews for a crate.<br>
            </p>
            <hr />
            <h2>web of trust</h2>
            <p>
                  New crev reviews are written by developers and committed to
                  crev
                  proof
                  repos and pushed to GitHub. From there they are available to
                  all.<br>
                  We need a system to trust this persons
                  to
                  trust
                  their reviews.
                  <b>cargo-crev</b> has a list of trusted persons.
                  But we personally only know a limited number of trusted
                  persons.
                  To make this circle bigger we need more people to trust.
                  When we trust somebody for reviews, we usually also trust
                  their choices to trust other people.
                  So we can trust also them. A little less, but still trust
                  them.<br>
                  This is an important part of the <b>web of trust</b>.<br>
                  It is common in every day life that the friends of our friends
                  are probably also our friends.
