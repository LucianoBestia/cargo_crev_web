# TODO

new reviews page - add crate and version

SqLite - numbers of crates/authors/reviews every day
to see the trend growing

write statistics every day, in a database to see it growing live.
write somewhere how many requests and for what.
Maybe the log could be ok, but I don't know how to use it.
SqlLite

On mobile it looks terrible.
In landscape is really ok, but in portrait just can't show the tables.
Maybe force the landscape ?


filters on author review
filters on global summary

unique authors for crate summary

- try to make more smaller crates. Like libraries.
Maybe the compiler will be faster then.
- when filters are Boxed<>, the compile is faster

code tour is unusable if it mix up line numbers

inform the author of a new review for his crate?
How to contact the author.
If the author is in the crev system, I have his Github repo.
There is possible to contact him.
the cargo_crev_web user can write an issue on his own repo.
And in this issue mention the author it has new reviews for ....
Your projects have xx new reviews.
All reviews: xxx
Watch on web.crev.dev


I would like to have a list: who uses this crate for what.
optional
