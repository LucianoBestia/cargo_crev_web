        <h2 class="dark_white under_line">cargo-crev</h2>
        <p><code>cargo-crev</code> is a cryptographically verifiable code review system for the cargo (Rust) package manager:<br>
            <a style="color:white" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/crev-dev/cargo-crev">https://github.com/crev-dev/cargo-crev</a>
        </p>
        <p><code>cargo-crev</code> runs locally on the developer computer.<br> It needs to be installed and initialized in a few steps.<br> It takes some time to initialize it and learn how to use it.
            <code>cargo-crev</code> is a relatively new project and the majority of rust developers don't have it installed yet.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            I created <code>cargo_crev_web</code> to enable all developers to view crev reviews.<br> There is no installation, initialization or learning needed. It is just a simple web page.<br> I wish that crates.io will have some day a link to
            <code>cargo_crev_web</code> just like today it has links to documentation and repository.<br> It simply shows a list of reviews for a crate.<br>
        </p>

        <h2 class="dark_white under_line">web of trust</h2>
        <p>
            New crev reviews are written by developers and committed to crev review repos and pushed to GitHub. From there they are available to all.
            <br> We need a system to trust this persons to trust their reviews.
            <code>cargo-crev</code> has a list of trusted persons. But we personally only know a limited number of trusted persons. To make this circle bigger we need more people to trust. When we trust somebody for reviews, we usually also trust their
            choices to trust other people. So we can trust also them. A little less, but still trust them.
            <br> This is an important part of the <code>web of trust</code>.<br> It is common in every day life that the friends of our friends are probably also our friends.

            This is a work in progress.<br /> - add badge/shield https://shields.io/endpoint<br /> - add more trusted rust developers<br /> - group by author
